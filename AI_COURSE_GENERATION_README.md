### API Endpoints

#### Generate Course
```http
POST /api/ai/generate-course
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "topic": "React Development",
  "difficulty": "intermediate",
  "duration": "8 weeks",
  "includeVideos": true,
  "includeQuizzes": true
}
```

#### Generate Learning Path
```http
POST /api/ai/generate-learning-path
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "skillLevel": "beginner",
  "interests": ["web development", "javascript"],
  "goals": "Become a full-stack developer",
  "availableTime": 10
}
```

#### Search YouTube Videos
```http
GET /api/ai/youtube/search?query=react%20tutorial&maxResults=5
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Services

#### GeminiService (`server/src/services/gemini.js`)
- Handles all AI content generation using Google Gemini Pro
- Generates course outlines, lesson content, and quiz questions
- Uses structured prompts for consistent output formatting

#### YouTubeService (`server/src/services/youtube.js`)
- Searches YouTube Data API for educational videos
- Scores videos based on relevance and educational value
- Extracts video metadata and suggests time frames

### AI Prompts

The system uses carefully crafted prompts to ensure:
- **Consistency**: Structured JSON outputs
- **Quality**: Educational focus and appropriate difficulty
- **Completeness**: Comprehensive course coverage
- **Relevance**: Topic-specific content generation

### Database Integration

Generated courses are stored with:
- Complete course structure (sections â†’ lessons)
- YouTube video URLs with time frames
- AI-generated quiz questions
- Metadata for tracking generation source

## Limitations & Considerations

### API Limits
- **Gemini API**: Rate limits and token costs
- **YouTube API**: Daily quota limits (10,000 units/day for free tier)
- **Content Quality**: AI-generated content should be reviewed before publishing

### Content Review
- AI-generated courses are created as drafts (`published: false`)
- Manual review recommended for accuracy and appropriateness
- Content may need localization or cultural adaptation

### Video Availability
- YouTube videos may be removed or become unavailable
- Time frames are suggestions and may need adjustment
- Consider providing alternative video sources

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-language Support**: Generate courses in different languages
- **Custom AI Models**: Fine-tune models for specific educational domains
- **Video Transcripts**: Extract and use video transcripts for content generation
- **Interactive Elements**: Generate code examples, diagrams, and interactive exercises
- **Progress Analytics**: Track learner engagement with AI-generated content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**: Verify API keys are correctly set in `.env`
2. **Quota Exceeded**: Monitor API usage and upgrade plans if needed
3. **Video Not Found**: Some topics may not have suitable educational videos
4. **Generation Timeout**: Complex topics may take longer to generate

### Monitoring

Check server logs for:
- API call successes/failures
- Generation time metrics
- Error rates and types

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be stored securely (environment variables)
- Rate limiting should be implemented for API endpoints
- User authentication required for course generation
- Generated content should be moderated before publishing
